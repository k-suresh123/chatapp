What is WebSocket and how it works?
A WebSocket is a persistent connection between a client and server. 
WebSockets provide a bidirectional, full-duplex communications channel that operates
 over HTTP through a single TCP/IP socket connection. At its core, 
 the WebSocket protocol facilitates message passing between a client and server.


1)websocket is not specific to nodejs andalso other technology too.
http protocl, websocket protocl allow us to communication
nodejs server ,one client or more than one client can connect too.
four clients can connect server using websocket

websocket protocl allow for full duplex communication
websocket is a separate protocl from HTTP

What protocol is used in WebSocket?
1.7.
The WebSocket protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. 
Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade request.
 By default the WebSocket protocol uses port 80 for regular WebSocket connections and port 443 for WebSocket connections tunneled over TLS [RFC2818].


WebSocket approach is ideal for real-time scalable application, whereas REST is better suited for the scenario with lots of getting request.
 WebSocket is a stateful protocol, whereas REST is based on stateless protocol, i.e. 
 the client does not need to know about the server and the same hold true for the server

 Is WebSocket faster than https?
Almost all the real-time applications like (trading, monitoring, notification) services use WebSocket to
receive the data on a single communication channel.
Simple RESTful application uses HTTP protocol which is stateless.
All the frequently updated applications used WebSocket because it is faster than HTTP Connection.

How do we create WebSocket?
Creating a WebSocket object

In order to communicate using the WebSocket protocol, 
you need to create a WebSocket object; this will automatically attempt to open the connection to the server.
 The URL to which to connect; this should be the URL to which the WebSocket server will respond.
